# üöÄ 2FA Implementation - Quick Verification Guide

## What Changed in Your App

### BEFORE (Insecure ‚ùå)
```
User registers ‚Üí Auto-signs in ‚Üí Can use app WITHOUT 2FA
User logs in with password ‚Üí Gets session WITHOUT verifying TOTP code
User can dismiss 2FA modal and skip setup
```

### AFTER (Secure ‚úÖ)
```
User registers ‚Üí 2FA modal appears (CANNOT CLOSE)
                ‚Üí User scans QR code ‚Üí Authenticator app setup
                ‚Üí Callback stores encrypted secret
                ‚Üí User can now use app (ONLY after 2FA complete)

User logs in ‚Üí Password verified (no session yet!)
              ‚Üí 2FA form appears
              ‚Üí User enters 8-digit TOTP code
              ‚Üí Code verified via rate-limited endpoint
              ‚Üí Session created (ONLY after password + TOTP verified)
```

## Critical Files to Understand

### 1. Authentication Flow
- **`app/(auth)/actions.ts`** - Login/register logic
  - Line 30: `login()` returns `2fa_required` BEFORE creating session
  - Line 86: `register()` no longer auto-signs in user
  - Line 105: New `verifyTOTPAndLogin()` completes login after TOTP

### 2. Login Component
- **`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`**
  - Shows login form
  - When `2fa_required` returned, switches to 2FA verification form
  - Passes email/password to verification form for later use

### 3. API Endpoints (New!)
- **`app/api/auth/verify-2fa-internal/route.ts`** (NEW)
  - Verifies TOTP code using email (not requiring session)
  - Rate limited: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - Used during login flow

- **`app/api/auth/signin-with-2fa/route.ts`** (NEW)
  - Signs in user after TOTP verification
  - Only called after verify-2fa-internal succeeds

### 4. 2FA Components
- **`components/custom/two-fa-setup-modal.tsx`**
  - `isMandatory` prop prevents closing
  - Register page passes `isMandatory={true}`

- **`components/custom/two-fa-verification-form.tsx`**
  - Accepts email/password for login flow
  - Has two verification paths

## How to Verify It's Working

### Quick Check #1: Register Flow
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/register
2. Enter test@example.com / password123
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. 2FA modal appears - TRY TO CLOSE IT
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Modal cannot be closed (good!)
5. Click "Enable 2FA"
6. Opens legitate.com in new window
7. Complete setup (scan QR code)
8. Close window
9. Modal closes automatically
10. You're now in the app ‚úÖ
```

### Quick Check #2: Login Flow  
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Enter test@example.com / password123
3. Click "Sign in"
4. Check browser console: Should see [LOGIN] logs
5. Look at response state:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ status: "2fa_required" (NOT "success")
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ User is NOT logged in yet
6. 2FA form appears
7. Enter 8-digit code from authenticator
8. Check browser console:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Calls /api/auth/verify-2fa-internal
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Then calls /api/auth/signin-with-2fa
9. Login completes ‚úÖ
10. You're now authenticated
```

### Quick Check #3: Rate Limiting
```
1. Go to login page
2. Get to 2FA form
3. Enter WRONG 8-digit code 5+ times
4. After 5th attempt:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Error: "Too many attempts, please try again later" (429)
5. Wait 15 minutes... (or test in new incognito window with different IP simulated)
```

### Quick Check #4: Database Verification
```sql
-- After registering with 2FA:
SELECT 
  email,
  totp_enabled,
  totp_secret,
  totp_setup_completed
FROM "user"
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Expected results:
-- email: test@example.com
-- totp_enabled: true
-- totp_secret: {"encrypted":"...", "iv":"...", "authTag":"..."}
-- totp_setup_completed: 2025-01-01 12:34:56
```

## What's Protected Now

### ‚úÖ Registration
- Cannot complete without 2FA setup
- Modal is non-dismissible
- Secret stored encrypted in database

### ‚úÖ Login  
- Session NOT created until TOTP verified
- Rate limited to prevent brute force (5 attempts / 15 min)
- Both password and TOTP must be valid

### ‚úÖ API Endpoints
- `/api/auth/setup-2fa` - requires authenticated session
- `/api/auth/verify-2fa` - requires authenticated session + rate limited
- `/api/auth/verify-2fa-internal` - requires valid email/TOTP + rate limited
- `/api/auth/signin-with-2fa` - completes login after TOTP

---

## Browser Console Logs to Look For

### During Registration:
```
[REGISTER] Starting registration process
[REGISTER] Form validated: { email: 'test@example.com' }
[REGISTER] User lookup result: { userExists: false, email: 'test@example.com' }
[REGISTER] Creating new user: { email: 'test@example.com' }
[REGISTER] User created successfully
[REGISTER] Returning success status - user must complete 2FA setup
```

### During Login (with 2FA):
```
[LOGIN] Starting login process
[LOGIN] Form validated: { email: 'test@example.com' }
[LOGIN] User lookup result: { userExists: true, email: 'test@example.com', totpEnabled: true }
[LOGIN] User has 2FA enabled, returning 2fa_required
```

### During TOTP Verification:
```
POST /api/auth/verify-2fa-internal
POST /api/auth/signin-with-2fa
```

---

## Testing Without Real Authenticator App

### Option 1: Use Fake TOTP Generator
```javascript
// In browser console, generate a fake 8-digit code:
Math.random().toString().slice(2, 10).padStart(8, '0')
// Output: "12345678" (example)
```
This won't actually verify, but tests the form validation.

### Option 2: Get Real Code from Authenticator
1. During 2FA setup, scan QR code with:
   - Google Authenticator
   - Microsoft Authenticator
   - Authy
   - Any TOTP app
2. App generates new 8-digit code every 30 seconds
3. Copy and paste code into login form

### Option 3: Extract Secret (For Testing)
After setup completes, the encrypted secret is in the database.
With `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, you could:
1. Decrypt the secret
2. Use a TOTP library to generate codes
3. Verify they match your authenticator app

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "User not authenticated" on setup-2fa
**Cause:** Not logged in when trying to set up 2FA
**Fix:** Only call setup-2fa AFTER registration or from authenticated session

### Issue: "Invalid TOTP code format"
**Cause:** Code must be exactly 8 digits
**Fix:** Verify authenticator app is generating 8-digit codes (not 6-digit)

### Issue: "Too many attempts" after 5 tries
**Cause:** Rate limiting is working (good!)
**Fix:** Wait 15 minutes or check rate limiter configuration

### Issue: Callback not triggering
**Cause:** CORS blocking GET request from legitate.com
**Fix:** Ensure callback URL is registered and whitelisted

### Issue: Secret not encrypting
**Cause:** `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` not set in `.env`
**Fix:** Generate 32-byte hex key and set `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
