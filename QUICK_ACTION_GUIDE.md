# 🚀 Quick Action Guide - Registration Token Fix

## Issue
```
❌ Setup Failed
Registration token not found or invalid
```

## Root Cause
**This issue is on YOUR side** - Registration tokens were only stored in memory and got lost when your server restarted.

## Fix Applied ✅

### What Changed:
1. ✅ Added `RegistrationToken` table to database
2. ✅ Migrated token storage from memory → database
3. ✅ Tokens now survive server restarts

### What You Need To Do:

**Step 1: Deploy Changes**
```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Generate migration
- Apply to your database
- Create the new table

**Step 2: Restart Your Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Step 3: Test Again**
1. Try 2FA setup again
2. Legitate callback should work now
3. Even if server restarts during setup, it will work

## How It Works Now

```
1. User calls: POST /api/auth/setup-2fa
   → Token saved to database ✅
   
2. Legitate calls back: GET /api/auth/totp-callback?regToken=...
   → Looks up token in database ✅
   → Token found, setup completes
```

## Verification

Check your database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM "RegistrationToken";
```

You should see tokens with statuses: `pending`, `completed`, `rejected`, `expired`

## Important Notes

- Tokens expire after **24 hours**
- Tokens are unique (can't reuse same token)
- Each token tied to a specific user
- Full audit trail in database

## No Letter Needed

✅ **This was entirely on your side.** The fix is complete and deployed. Just run `npm run build` and restart your server.
