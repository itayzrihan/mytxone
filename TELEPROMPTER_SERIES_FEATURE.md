# Teleprompter Series Navigation & Countdown Recording Feature

## Overview

I've successfully enhanced the teleprompter with three major features:

1. **Series Navigation** - Browse through a sequence of scripts with Previous/Next buttons
2. **Countdown Timer** - Professional 5-4-3-2-1 countdown with sound and visual effects
3. **Seamless Recording Integration** - Countdown automatically triggers before recording starts

---

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. Series Navigation ðŸ“‹

**What's New:**
- When a script is part of a series, navigation buttons appear at the top of the teleprompter
- Shows:
  - **Folder icon** with series name
  - **Current position** (e.g., "2 / 5")
  - **Previous/Next buttons** to navigate between scripts
  - Disabled buttons when at the start or end of series

**Where to Find It:**
- Location: Top-left of teleprompter controls, next to "Back" button
- Buttons: `<ChevronLeft>` and `<ChevronRight>` icons
- Only visible when script is part of a series

**How It Works:**
- Fetches series information via `/api/scripts/[id]/series`
- Displays the series name and position in the series
- Navigation buttons update the URL to the next/previous script
- Maintains all playback settings when switching scripts

### 2. Countdown Recorder Component ðŸ”´

**Component: `countdown-recorder.tsx`**

**Features:**
- **5-4-3-2-1 Countdown**: Large, glowing numbers that fill the screen
- **Sound Effects**: 
  - Each number (5,4,3,2,1) has a unique beep sound (440-600 Hz range)
  - "GO!" gets a dual-tone beep (600 Hz + 800 Hz)
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Multiple glow layers (cyan â†’ blue â†’ indigo gradient)
  - Pulsing rings that expand outward
  - Text shadow with layered glow effect
  - Smooth scale animations
  - Animation duration: 1 second per number

**Technical Details:**
- Uses Web Audio API for sound generation
- CSS animations for visual effects
- Positioned as a fixed overlay covering the entire screen
- `z-index: 50` ensures it's above all other elements

### 3. Recording Workflow Integration ðŸŽ¥

**Before Recording:**
1. User clicks the **Record button**
2. Countdown component displays (5-4-3-2-1-GO!)
3. Countdown plays through entire sequence

**After Countdown:**
1. Countdown completes with "GO!" message
2. `onCountdownComplete` callback fires
3. Actual recording starts with `startRecordingInternal()`
4. User can now speak/act

**Benefits:**
- Gives users time to prepare
- Creates professional video with synchronized start
- Audio remains clean (countdown doesn't record)
- Smooth transition from countdown to active recording
