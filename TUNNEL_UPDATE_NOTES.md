# 🆕 UPDATE: Automatic Tunnel Detection

## What Changed

The `npm run dev` command is now **even smarter**:

### ✅ New Automatic Features
- **Auto-detects** if tunnels are running
- **Auto-launches** tunnels if missing
- **Shows countdown** timer (50 seconds)
- **Waits for initialization** before starting dev
- **Continues anyway** if timeout (allows manual intervention)

---

## Usage (Unchanged)

```powershell
npm run dev
```

That's it! ✅

The script now:
1. Checks if tunnels are running
2. Launches them automatically if needed
3. Waits up to 50 seconds for connection
4. Starts dev server when ready

---

## No Manual Tunnel Start Needed! 🎉

### Before
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Manual tunnel start
npm run tunnels:start

# Terminal 2: Dev server
npm run dev:no-tunnels

# Manual cleanup
npm run tunnels:stop
```

### Now
```powershell
# Just one command!
npm run dev

# Automatic tunnel detection & launch
# Automatic dev server start
# Everything managed for you!
```

## Example Output

```
🌐 Starting SSH tunnels and dev server...

🔍 Checking for existing tunnels...
⚠️  PostgreSQL tunnel not detected on port 53332
⚠️  Redis tunnel not detected on port 6189

📡 Starting SSH tunnels in separate window...
⏳ Waiting up to 50 seconds for tunnel initialization...

⏳ Waiting for tunnel on port 53332... 48s remaining
⏳ Waiting for tunnel on port 6189... 47s remaining

✅ All tunnels initialized successfully!

🚀 Starting Next.js dev server...

- ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000

## Still Available (If You Need Them)

```powershell
npm run dev:no-tunnels        # Dev without auto-tunnels
npm run tunnels:start         # Manual tunnel start
npm run tunnels:stop          # Manual tunnel stop
```

## TL;DR

✅ Same command: `npm run dev`  
✅ Better experience: Auto tunnel detection  
✅ Faster setup: No manual tunnel steps  
✅ Smarter: Waits for tunnels, then starts dev  
✅ Continues: Even if timeout, dev starts anyway  

**That's all you need to know!** 🚀
