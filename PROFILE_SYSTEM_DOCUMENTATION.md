# User Profile System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive professional profile system has been implemented for MyTX.one, allowing users to view and edit their profiles with a modern neon-styled interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Profile Page Route** (`/user/{username}`)
- **Location**: `/app/user/[username]/page.tsx`
- **Access**: `/user/john` (for user with email `john@mytx.one`)
- **Features**:
  - View own profile with edit capabilities
  - View other users' public profiles (read-only)
  - Neon-styled, centered, professional design
  - Responsive on mobile and desktop

### 2. **Profile Information Management**
Users can edit the following fields:
- ✅ **Full Name** - Editable text field
- ✅ **Phone Number** - Editable phone field
- ✅ **External Email** - Editable email field (personal/business email)
- ✅ **Profile Image** - Upload and change profile picture (max 5MB)
- ❌ **MyTX Email** - Read-only (username@mytx.one cannot be changed)
- 📊 **Subscription Plan** - Display only

### 3. **API Endpoints**

#### GET `/api/user/profile`
- Fetches current authenticated user's profile
- Used by the original profile update flow

#### GET `/api/user/profile/[username]`
- Fetches a specific user's profile by username
- Returns public profile information
- No authentication required for viewing

#### PUT `/api/user/profile`
- Updates current authenticated user's profile
- Handles form data including image uploads
- Converts images to base64 for storage
- Validates image size (max 5MB)

### 4. **User Menu Integration**
- **Location**: `/components/custom/user-menu.tsx`
- "My Profile" link added to dropdown menu
- Links to `/user/{username}` using the current user's username
- Positioned above "Manage API Keys" option

### 5. **UI/UX Design**

#### Color Scheme (Neon Style)
- Primary: Cyan (`#06B6D4`)
- Secondary: Blue (`#3B82F6`)
- Tertiary: Purple (`#A855F7`)
- Dark Background: Gray-900 to Black gradient

#### Components
- Neon glowing border effect using gradient and blur
- Animated profile picture upload button
- Status indicators (success/error messages)
- Loading states with spinners
- Responsive card layout

#### View Modes
1. **Own Profile** (Editable):
   - Full form with all editable fields
   - Save and Cancel buttons
   - Image upload capability
   
2. **Other Users' Profiles** (Read-only):
   - Display-only view
   - Shows available information
   - No edit capability
   - Go Back button

### 6. **Database Schema**
The system utilizes existing user table columns:
- `email` (primary identifier, cannot be edited)
- `fullName`
- `phoneNumber`
- `notMytxEmail`
- `profileImageUrl` (stored as base64 data URI)
- `subscription`

## File Structure
```
app/
  ├── user/
  │   └── [username]/
  │       └── page.tsx (Profile page with dynamic routing)
  │
  ├── api/
  │   └── user/
  │       └── profile/
  │           ├── route.ts (PUT endpoint for own profile)
  │           └── [username]/
  │               └── route.ts (GET endpoint for user profiles)
  │
components/
  └── custom/
      └── user-menu.tsx (Updated with profile link)
```

## How to Use

### View Your Profile
1. Click your username in the top-right menu
2. Select "My Profile"
3. You'll be taken to `/user/{your_username}`

### Edit Your Profile
1. Go to your profile page
2. Update any of the editable fields
3. Upload a new profile picture if desired
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Receive success confirmation via toast notification

### View Other Users' Profiles
1. Navigate to `/user/{username}` (e.g., `/user/john`)
2. View their public profile information (read-only)
3. Cannot edit other users' profiles

## Technical Implementation

### Image Handling
- Images are converted to base64 data URIs
- Stored directly in the database
- Supports all common image formats (jpg, png, gif, webp, etc.)
- Maximum size: 5MB with validation

### Error Handling
- User not found → 404 with appropriate message
- Unauthorized access → 401 redirect to home
- Image too large → Error message displayed
- Profile update failures → Toast notification with error details

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layout for tablets and desktops
- Touch-friendly controls on mobile
- Adjusted padding and spacing for different screen sizes

## Security Considerations
- Authentication required for profile editing
- Users can only edit their own profiles
- MyTX email address protected from editing
- Images validated for file size and type
- Base64 encoding for safe image storage

## Future Enhancements
- Profile picture URL option (instead of just uploads)
- Social media links
- Bio/About section
- Verification badges
- Profile visibility settings (public/private)
- Profile completion percentage indicator
- Activity feed
- User following/followers system
