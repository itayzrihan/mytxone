# üß™ 2FA Testing Guide

## Fixed Issues ‚úÖ

### Database Connection Issue
**Problem**: `ECONNRESET` when trying to register
**Root Cause**: `queries.ts` was forcing `?sslmode=require` even when using local SSH tunnel
**Solution**: Modified `getDb()` to check if `sslmode` already exists in connection URL before appending

### Connection Flow
```
Local App ‚Üí SSH Tunnel (port 53332) ‚Üí Remote PostgreSQL (85.215.209.220:5432)
                                    (Connection is unencrypted locally, SSH handles the encryption)
```

## Test Procedure

### Step 1: Register Account

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:3000/register
2. **Fill form**:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. **Watch console** for logs:
   ```
   [REGISTER] Starting registration process
   [REGISTER] Form validated: { email: 'test@example.com' }
   [DB] Connecting to database: postgresql://mytxonepost:***@localhost:53332/mytxone?sslmode=disable
   [REGISTER] User lookup result: { userExists: false, email: 'test@example.com' }
   [REGISTER] Creating new user: { email: 'test@example.com' }
   [REGISTER] User created successfully
   [REGISTER] Attempting to sign in user
   [REGISTER] Sign in successful
   [REGISTER] Returning success status
   ```
4. **Expected**: Should see success toast and 2FA setup modal appears

### Step 2: Enable 2FA

1. **Modal appears** after registration: "Add 2FA to your account"
2. **Click "Enable 2FA"** button
3. **Redirected** to Legitate (https://legitate.com/dashboard/simple-totp)
4. **Scan QR Code** with authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
5. **Complete setup** on Legitate
6. **Browser callback** happens automatically
7. **Check database** - should see 2FA enabled:
   ```sql
   SELECT email, totp_enabled, totp_setup_completed 
   FROM "User" 
   WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```
   Expected result: `totp_enabled = true`, `totp_setup_completed = timestamp`

### Step 3: Log Out

1. **Navigate** to home page or account settings
2. **Click logout** button
3. **Verify** redirected to login page

### Step 4: Log Back In with 2FA

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/login
2. **Enter credentials**:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. **Watch console** for 2FA detection:
   ```
   [LOGIN] Starting login process
   [LOGIN] Form validated: { email: 'test@example.com' }
   [DB] Connecting to database: postgresql://mytxonepost:***@localhost:53332/mytxone?sslmode=disable
   [LOGIN] User lookup result: { userExists: true, totpEnabled: true }
   [LOGIN] User has 2FA enabled, returning 2fa_required
   ```
4. **Expected**: Login form disappears, "Verify 2FA Code" form appears
5. **Get code** from authenticator app (8 digits)
6. **Enter code** in the 2FA form
7. **Submit** and verify login succeeds

### Step 5: Test Edge Cases

#### Wrong Code
1. Log out again
2. Try logging in with wrong code
3. **Expected**: Error message appears

#### Rate Limiting (5+ wrong attempts)
1. Try entering wrong code 5+ times
2. **Expected**: "Too many attempts, please try again later" error after 5th attempt
3. **Note**: Should automatically unblock after 15 minutes or you can clear Redis

#### Expired Code
1. Wait 30+ seconds
2. Enter old code
3. **Expected**: Code rejected (TOTP codes expire after 30 seconds)

## Console Logs to Watch For

### Registration Success
```
[REGISTER] Starting registration process
[REGISTER] Form validated: { email: '...' }
[REGISTER] User lookup result: { userExists: false, ... }
[REGISTER] Creating new user: ...
[REGISTER] User created successfully
[REGISTER] Attempting to sign in user
[REGISTER] Sign in successful
[REGISTER] Returning success status
```

### 2FA Required During Login
```
[LOGIN] Starting login process
[LOGIN] Form validated: { email: '...' }
[LOGIN] User lookup result: { userExists: true, totpEnabled: true }
[LOGIN] User has 2FA enabled, returning 2fa_required
```

### Successful Login Without 2FA
```
[LOGIN] Starting login process
[LOGIN] Form validated: { email: '...' }
[LOGIN] User lookup result: { userExists: true, totpEnabled: false }
[LOGIN] No 2FA enabled, proceeding with normal login
[LOGIN] Sign in successful
```

## Database Connection Log

After fix, you should see:
```
[DB] Connecting to database: postgresql://mytxonepost:***@localhost:53332/mytxone?sslmode=disable
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Connection string has `sslmode=disable` (no SSL locally)
- ‚úÖ Connecting to `localhost:53332` (SSH tunnel)
- ‚úÖ Database credentials properly masked in logs

---

## SSH Tunnel Status

Should see on startup:
```
üîç Checking for existing tunnels...
‚úÖ PostgreSQL tunnel is running on port 53332
‚úÖ Redis tunnel is running on port 6189
‚úÖ All tunnels already active! Proceeding with dev server...
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting ECONNRESET
1. Check tunnels running: `netstat -ano | findstr :53332`
2. Check SSH processes: `Get-Process ssh`
3. Restart dev server: Stop and run `npm run dev` again
4. Check connection string in `.env.local` has `sslmode=disable`

### Issue: 2FA Modal Not Showing
1. Check registration returned `success` status
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify user was created in database
4. Try refreshing page

### Issue: Authenticator Code Not Working
1. Check authenticator app time is synced (Settings ‚Üí Time synchronization)
2. Try a different authenticator app
3. Check 8-digit format (should be all numbers)
4. Make sure you're within 30-second window

### Issue: Rate Limit Blocking
1. Clear Redis or wait 15 minutes
2. Use different email address
3. Check UPSTASH_REDIS credentials in `.env.local`

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `db/queries.ts` | Fixed SSL mode handling in `getDb()` |
| `app/(auth)/actions.ts` | Added comprehensive logging to login/register |

## Next Steps After Successful Test

2. ‚úÖ Check database has 2FA data correctly
3. ‚úÖ Verify rate limiting works
4. ‚úÖ Test with multiple accounts
5. ‚úÖ Remove debug console.log statements before production

---

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Remove/minimize `console.log` statements
- [ ] Set `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in production environment
- [ ] Verify SSH tunnels or direct connection works in production
- [ ] Test 2FA end-to-end in production
- [ ] Enable proper monitoring for failed 2FA attempts
- [ ] Document 2FA setup for users
- [ ] Create password reset flow that requires 2FA verification
- [ ] Test account recovery with backup codes (optional enhancement)

**You're all set!** Go test and enjoy your 2FA implementation! üéâ
