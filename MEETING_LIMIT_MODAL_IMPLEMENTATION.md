# Meeting Limit Modal - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Enhanced Meeting Limit Modal Component** ✨

**File**: `components/custom/meeting-limit-modal.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Now fully reusable with plan-aware logic
- ✅ Supports both Free (1 meeting) and Basic (3 meetings) plans
- ✅ Added visual progress bar showing current vs. limit
- ✅ Plan-specific icons and styling (Yellow for Free, Orange for Basic)
- ✅ Optional callbacks for customizable actions
- ✅ Clear upgrade path with plan-specific benefits
- ✅ Mode prop for flexibility ('reached' or 'warning')

### 2. **Upgrade Wall Integration** 🚀

**File**: `components/custom/upgrade-plan-wall.tsx`

**Added**:
- Import of `MeetingLimitModal` component
- State for tracking meeting count: `userMeetingCount`
- State for modal visibility: `showMeetingLimitModal`
- New function: `fetchUserMeetingCount()` - Fetches current active meetings
- Enhanced handler: `handleStartFreeClick()` - Checks limit before allowing creation
- Updated "START FREE" button to use new handler
- Modal rendered with proper configuration

**Flow When Free User Clicks "START FREE"**:
```
User clicks "START FREE"
    ↓
handleStartFreeClick() executes
    ↓
Fetch user's meeting count from /api/user/plan
    ↓
If currentCount >= 1:
    └─→ Show MeetingLimitModal with upgrade options
    ↓
If currentCount < 1:
    └─→ Open CreateMeetingDialog to create meeting
```

### 3. **Owned Meetings Page Update** 📝

**File**: `app/owned-meetings/page.tsx`

**Updated**:
- Enhanced `MeetingLimitModal` component usage with new props
- Added `mode="reached"` prop
- Added `onRemoveMeeting` callback for custom handling

**Flow When User Creates Meeting**:
```
handleCreateClick() executes
    ↓
Check if currentCount >= limit for plan
    ├─ Free: 1 meeting limit
    ├─ Basic: 3 meeting limit
    └─ Pro: Unlimited
    ↓
If limit reached:
    └─→ Show MeetingLimitModal with remove/upgrade options
    ↓
If under limit:
    └─→ Open CreateMeetingDialog
```

## Key Features

### 🎯 Plan-Aware Detection

| Plan | Limit | Trigger |
|------|-------|---------|
| Free | 1 | When user tries to create 2nd meeting |
| Basic | 3 | When user tries to create 4th meeting |
| Pro | ∞ | Never shown |

### 📊 Visual Elements

**Progress Bar**:
- Shows: `Current Meetings / Limit`
- Colors: Yellow (free) or Orange (basic)
- Updates in real-time

**Icons**:
- Free: ⚠️ AlertTriangle (Yellow)
- Basic: ⚡ Zap (Orange)

**Upgrade Benefits**:
Free → Basic:
- Create up to 3 active meetings
- Advanced meeting features
- Priority support

Basic → Pro:
- Unlimited active meetings
- All pro features
- 24/7 premium support

### 🔄 User Interactions

**Option 1: Remove a Meeting**
- Closes modal
- Navigates to owned-meetings page (optional)
- User can delete an old meeting

**Option 2: Upgrade Plan**
- Navigates to /pricing
- User can select basic or pro plan

## Backend Integration

**Endpoint**: `/api/user/plan` (GET)

```typescript
Response: {
  plan: "free" | "basic" | "pro",
  meetingCount: number  // Only active meetings
}
```

**What "Active" Means**:
- Meeting has not ended yet
- Counts only upcoming/ongoing meetings
- Past meetings don't count toward limit
