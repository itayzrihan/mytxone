## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration
```
/api/user/plan (GET)
├─ Returns: { plan, meetingCount }
├─ Only counts active meetings
├─ Filters by user ID from session
└─ Used to determine if limit is reached
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Modal display
const [showMeetingLimitModal, setShowMeetingLimitModal] = useState(false);

// Meeting count
const [userMeetingCount, setUserMeetingCount] = useState(0);

// Fetch function
const fetchUserMeetingCount = async () => { ... }
```

### Component Integration
```tsx
import { MeetingLimitModal } from "@/components/custom/meeting-limit-modal";

<MeetingLimitModal
  open={showMeetingLimitModal}
  onOpenChange={setShowMeetingLimitModal}
  currentCount={userMeetingCount}
  limit={getLimitForPlan(userPlan)}
  plan={userPlan}
  onRemoveMeeting={handleRemoveMeeting}
/>
```
